    <p>My name is Chris, and I'm trying to learn modern web development.</p>

<p>I define how websites should look and act in my day job, but it's been quite a while since I've done any programming myself. Plus, when I did I usually built traditional applications, like the ones that run on Windows.</p>
 
<p>I used Visual Basic, C, and Borland Delphi to build those programs. Man, did I love Delphi.</p>

<p>That was fun, but no one does that anymore.</p>
