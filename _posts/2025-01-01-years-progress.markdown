I gave myself permission to do more tinkering this past year and rediscover some of the joy of computing I used to experience more often. This was before kids (whom make time scarce but supply an abundance of joy on their own).

For starters, I built a new desktop workstation (replacing one I built around ~2017, using the same ATX case and all). I also:

* Stood up a hasty new [personal site](https://chris.bajgier.net) using [Astro](https://astro.build)
* Built other small, landing page style sites with Astro (and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com))
* Set up a [git](https://git-scm.com/) publishing workflow for the above
* Hacked this [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)-based site (with it's over ten-year-old stylesheet) into a near responsive view, and made other small enhancements (including proper [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) support, excerpts, better images) along the way
* Finally got a handle on enabling SSL for all of my sites
* Built a few [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) sites, for myself and others
* Experimented with running (and connecting to) LLMs locally
* Played around with self hosting with a new [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/), installing great software like [penpot](https://penpot.app/), [Gitea](https://about.gitea.com/) and more

I want to keep the learning going in 2025. The first order of business is moving all of my personal web stuff off of [GoDaddy](https://godaddy.com) onto something better. Beyond that, I'm looking to:

* Fully equip my [personal homepage](https://chris.bajgier.net) with the sections I want and keep it maintained
* Wrangle reading [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) and [JSON](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_json.asp) via web services to the point it feels native to me
* Build a custom WordPress plugin
* Write a small mobile app

These are different than my professional aspirations for the new year. The goal is to experience a bit of building things by oneself for the sake of learning, experiencing a state of [flow](https://www.headspace.com/articles/flow-state) and building up the [hippocampus](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/hippocampus). It's also about contributing something to the "open web" and enjoying the fraternity of others who do the same ([About Ideas Now](https://aboutideasnow.com/) is an inspiring spot to check out).
