Like many others of late, I've been contemplating the relationship technology has to my life and experiences working within it. A tagline on my old [about.me](https://about.me) page, the page that served as a generic introduction of me for years, embedded in my personal home page...

> I believe technology has the ability to change and enrich lives.

It's no longer there. [about.me](https://about.me), like many genuinely useful properties that were created in the heyday of "Web 2.0", is longer cooperating with the wider web. 

Do I still believe in the promise of technology? Yes, when it is developed with an understanding of human nature, and serves human interests. 

The term "techno-optimist" has been co-opted by those who want technology to advance without guardrails, without pause or deliberation. That's not me. When I looked ahead, there was naivete on my part on how the pull of helping other people and providing value to them could keep technology development tempered and, by default, infused with goodwill. Yes, some of that goodwill was a byproduct of selfish interests, constructed with just a layman's understanding of Adam Smith's definition of capitalism and the intelligence of markets. 

Where we're at lives outside the bounds of his classical definition and not even the internet, egalitarian and open by default, has been conquered by extractive models. My concept of the internet was shaped by the rough and tumble early days where companies forged out a humble and beneficial online presence alongside pages with individual expression and community-developed "third spaces".

I spent much of my time in the early web evangelizing and teaching my friends, family members, and colleagues how to use it. I could see the challenges and the cognitive lift it took to figure out arcane parts of the web experience -- coding, file transfer, hosting. There's a story yet to be fully told about the tragic role I played in the bargain between Silicon Valley and the everyday people who were needful of a way to develop their web presence. Here, the burden of technical nuance led them to unknowingly surrender their future agency and squelch the promise of an internet that works for them. 

It was a scam. There, along with the trojan horse-like expansion of social media into the open web (through externalized comments, likes, shares and the metadata) initially helped the conversational aspect of open web, only to pull back and shift it's content and lifeblood to their own platform. Again, contributing to the open web in a superficially altruistic way at first, shifting the way to gain an audience toward their favor (and eventually their platform), then closing of the door and the reach individuals and groups could have to within their revenue engine, just to tick up their MAUs a little higher.

Now what's left of that promise is being targeted by aggressive accumulation of human-produced content to train generative AI models and serve those remnants back to humans in an one-sided way that will subvert the remaining cooperative aspects of the web. Its an extractive play that will be short-lived but destructive, as the humans producing and sharing can no longer see themselves in the system, and the well of contemporary knowledge for AI to plunder will go dry.

In the past few months, I've found comfort in building, and helping others build, websites that serve their personal or group goals. It's been cathartic. Working on my own meager web presence has nourished me with learning opportunities and experiences of flow. Committing myself to writing and building up my capacity for advocacy within the product and consumer space has given me a glimmer of hope to seize upon. My path from here is fuzzy but grows clearer at every step.
