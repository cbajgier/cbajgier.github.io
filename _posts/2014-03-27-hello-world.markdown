My name is Chris, and I'm trying to learn modern web development.

I define how web sites should look and act in my day job, but it's been quite a while since I've done any programming myself. Plus, when I did I usually built traditional applications, like the ones that run on Windows.
 
I used Visual Basic, C, and Borland Delphi to build those programs. Man, did I love Delphi.

That was fun, but no one does that anymore.
