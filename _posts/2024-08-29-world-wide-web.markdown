If you want to feel like your life is slipping away, spend an afternoon coding up your first Jekyll blog with an ambitious plan to regale the internet public with stories about the love that you have for computers and the halcyon days gone by. Promise yourself you'll keep it fresh and updated when you get a chance, then return to it, languishing, a good _ten years later_.

Damn.
