The bookshelf in my living room is roughly arranged like this:

| 2 | Business/personal improvement |
| 3 | History/Political works |
| 4 | **Programming** |
| 5 | **Programming** |
| 6 | Misc/Photo books of muscle cars |

### Fun Facts ###

* A couple of the C/C++ books I have came via starter kits bundled with older versions of Microsoft/Borland IDEs.
* Delphi Studio is boxed software, but that thing came filled with books so it deserves to be here.
* "Kick Ass Delphi" is a fun little book I read when unnecessary profanity was still amusing to me. It followed a story format, featuring  a Delphi detective of sorts involved in the case of his career. I think I made a couple of screensavers with info from this book.
* I struggled to learn Windows programming using the C++/MFC tutorials in "Learn Visual C++ Now", and instead followed a single example in that book illustrating C/message loop/direct Win API calls to build my first Windows applications.
* It's not pictured here, but I also have an autographed copy of ["Linux Programming Unleashed"](http://smile.amazon.com/Linux-Programming-Unleashed-Kurt-Wall/dp/0672320215/ref=la_B001IQZK00_1_4?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1396410006&sr=1-4). My uncle knew the author (Kurt Wall) and asked him to sign it for me, which was extremely cool.
* "Using Linux" included Red Hat, Slackware, and Caldera Linux, though I failed to get any of those to install at the time.
