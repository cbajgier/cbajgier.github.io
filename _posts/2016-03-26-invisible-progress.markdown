While it hasn't looked like much, and no one's really counting anyway, I have been making solid progress and have made significant steps in my programming journey in 2015.

One of my 2015 resolutions was to learn a new, modern programming language, initially targeting Ruby. An elegant language and ultimately I was able to build out a number of small utilities and one Jekyll application as substance. That in itself was a large step as it took some time to wrap my head around the concept of a DSL and their novel (to me) spin on application structure.

On a roll, I signed up for Coursera's [_Programming for Everybody_](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python) course, an excellent, free (when I took it) overview of beginner Python out of Michigan. Successful completion of that, plus a good conversation with the great people at the [Pittsburgh Python User Group](http://pghpython.org/), convinced me to switch my efforts to Python. I had to make a list though:

#### Python vs. Ruby

Since then, I've written even more small utilities in Python and started my master project in Django. So yeah, even though I haven't done much on the site, I've learned a ton _"offline"_ and enjoyed participating in the local community while doing it.
