I signed up for my first Twitter account in 2008. As mentioned earlier, [I helped the organization I was a part of stand up their first brand Twitter account](/society/technology/values/2024/11/30/blue-skies.html). That didn't come about because of any particular skill I had in navigating the wild west of corporate social media engagement but from the fact that when the leaders of my team looked to recruit someone to manage it I had the earliest personal account timestamp. Since then, I've held on to two accounts on the platform. Today, I deactivated both.

My accounts had no real base or influence. I haven't posted much. Initially, it was a place to engage with those I knew and cared about. Later, I used it like a more intrusive RSS reader as more publications I enjoyed prioritized that presence, but this got old quickly.

Most recently, I used it to follow the work of people I admired. Responsible tech, government officials, disinformation researchers, independent journalists. Real "truth-to-power" types. Through a turbulent last few years (the [George Floyd protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd_protests) being that an inflection point), it was a marginally reassuring way to express solidarity and feel connected to the zeitgeist of the moment. It helped to know there were people committed to solving the problems of our time. Without much by way of aids to migrate, these fine folks have largely made their way to [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org) or [Bluesky](https://bsky.app).
