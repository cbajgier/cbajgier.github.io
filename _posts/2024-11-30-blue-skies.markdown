I don't consider myself an extroverted person. My time on the internet has been one of a professional lurker -- deeply interested in the intersections between society and technology, but not particularly interested in joining myself. There's probably a number of reasons that I haven't fully unpacked, but the best way I can describe it is as a pregnant pause before I contribute anything in a public space. Sometimes it's an indefinite pause.

The net result is that I haven't had the chance to experience the sense of online community that others may have. A shame, but I've also avoided much of it's whirlwinds and have them emotionally tug me along one way or the other. And, being on the outside of everything, invisible, seemed to develop within myself some kind of forced empathy since I wasn't putting my voice out there in competition with others. Hopefully it's also kept me humble without the ego to protect, and independent, not drawn into a group identity as easily.

So it takes a lot of prodding to overcome that and put some of myself out there for public consumption. Self interest and ego would be a better motivator, but I can only muster the pangs of duty. The online spaces we wander in have had an increasingly detrimental impact on real life. Serious matters that require more consideration and care than we're willing to give it in a hyper-connected world with an incentive structure that rewards noise more than it does signal. Pushing myself to contribute more externally, for the sake of understanding the phenomenon so that I can positively impact it, takes conscious effort.

I'm following the emergence of new outlets for human social expression, the "town square" category of social networks: [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/), [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/), Sez (https://sez.us), [Unified](https://www.joinunified.us/), and one developed locally in alpha. Some of my interest is in seeing something displace Twitter, which is now an instrument of pushing the [Overton Window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window) to mainstream radical reactionary politics. Part is discovering more about how digital influence shows up in the competing models and understanding the opportunity for progressive impact. And some of it is to reacquaint myself with the patterns for sharing and discussion, and how the firehose of content impresses upon tired minds so that I can provide relief in a social network (or rather, "service") I'm currently conceptualizing (with a more healthful value proposition). One, by the way, that wouldn't be in direct competition with any of these, but rather addresses the problem of Facebook undermining human relationships.

I helped guide a former employer in navigating the social media frontier of Twitter, back when it had more popular appeal. It was tough to figure out how to engage customers and prospects on the site and the opportunity was vague, but the hype surrounding the new service meant some move needed to be made. What I took away from that experience how narrow and controllable a brand identity is online vs. an individualism. In fact, we needed to strip our individualism and the idiosyncrasies that come with it out of our published tweets, and this was more of a challenge.

There's an upper bound to what people can pay attention to in the "tweetosphere" flavor of social media, and if you want to engage in influence and audience-building, you need to pull back on who you are in favor of your own "personal brand". I can appreciate the difficulty involved here, with the richness of their personhood to whittle down, to create a consistent brand. Even more so, I admire the courage one has to offer up truly authentic bits of themselves to that carefully curated audience. The cross between the business risk (for fear of alienating "prospects") and a show of messy individual expression that brings the human behind it to the forefront fascinates me.

So I've made the choice to be a bit loose in my social network presence, to allow myself to just have an _experience_. Give in to the parts of me that be wrong, frivolous, sloppy, uncoordinated. Not to cause any harm, but allow for the occasional misfire that happens in an imprecise medium. Hopefully learning from it, but not stressing too much about aligning to an objective.

For what it's worth, Bluesky is where I'll be spending most of my time. I am absolutely of the belief that true decentralized offerings like Mastodon are best for the long-term prospect of a vibrant internet and know there's risk of the incentives behind the Bluesky to creep out alignment and be another example of extractive technology. It's having a moment, though, and if the value of a new tech service is qualified in what it "disrupts", fomenting a mass migration away from a newly politically weaponized service feels like progress.
