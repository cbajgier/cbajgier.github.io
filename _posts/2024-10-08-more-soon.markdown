They say "necessity is the mother of invention", and I've outfitted this blog site with a way to excerpt long posts after drafting a post much too lengthy for the front page.

Rejuvenating this site is part of my deliberate practice to improve my writing. It's meant to be a cathartic exercise, too, and the prospect of a meager audience (only by ways of this being publicly accessible), grounds me in my choice of language and the context I'd set.

The site is also newly responsive, though I'd need to re-architect parts of the theme itself to incorporate all sections in a responsive way. Right now, the focus is on the reading experience of a post. This site uses a theme that I authored first as a [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) theme, then [Blogger](https://blogger.com) for my personal blog back when I was an undergraduate student (over twenty years ago).
