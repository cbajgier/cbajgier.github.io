After a bit of afternoon hacking around, I was able to port over an old theme to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and install it on this site. This code came from the less sophisticated [Blogger](http://blogger.com) cousin to the [Wordpress](http://www.wordpress.org) theme I'm trying to port to [Ghost](http://ghost.org), so it's got quite the family history.

It's a good exercise to help me get familiar with the theme structure and fill in any of the development/theming gaps I want to before attempting them on the [Abstract-Ghost](https://github.com/cbajgier/abstract-ghost) project.

~~I roughly sketched out what the mobile breakpoint of this theme would look like, so a responsive view is on the short list.~~ Here's a few other things I'd like to add:

* Open Graph/Google Structured Data markup
* "Send to Kindle" button support
* ~~RSS support (I still appreciate sites that support this)~~
* Golden ratio/typographic golden ratio, 960 grid
* Web fonts/font icons
* Cover image
* All the Facebook/Twitter/G+ sharing button support
* Category/tag navigation
* Better site meta-data configuration in Jekyll
* Article excerpt support
* Post formatting fixes, including images and tables
