I've already put my goals out there for public consumption (and ridicule). But what's my plan?

"Business Model You" is a great book, and I'm using it as a springboard to help me think through the longer term life and career goals I have, so I can start doing the things I need to do today. That's going to get me a plan, and reviving my programing mind is on the list.

When it comes to programming, though, a plan is just going to slow me down. I immersed myself in what's available to build a new web app, and there's plenty. I've read countless articles right now on MVC frameworks (in multiple languages), comparisons on scripting languages, tutorial videos on building apps in things like Sinatra and Express, played around (and broke) with skeleton code, all that good stuff.



It didn't used to be this way. Back when I started, you had a few high-level languages to realistically choose from, integrated IDEs that you had to pay for.

I know a full realization of the tools our there will make the tasks. So, I'm okay with doing it the hard way; okay with some RY (repeat yourself). This will be a learning experience.
